  ABSTRACT: Phelix¹ is a high-speed stream cipher with a built-in MAC functionality. It is efficient in both hardware and software. On current Pentium CPUs, Phelix has a per-packet overhead of less than 900 clocks, plus a per-byte cost well under 8 clocks per byte, comparing very favorably with the best AES (encryption-only) implementations, even for small packets.

  ¹ Pronounced "felix" (rhymes with "helix").
