   --
   --  Prove additional properties of the types declared in the parent
   --  package.
   --
   --  These proofs are not actively used anywhere, but they should help
   --  building confidence in the correctness of certain subprograms.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   --  Stream conversions
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   --  Fully prove bijectivity of conversion subprogram(s).

   --  Part I

   --  Converting a Word_32 into a stream representation and converting
   --  the stream back into a Word_32 should result in the same value.
   pragma Assert (for all W in Word_32'Range =>
                    To_Unsigned (General_Stream'(To_Stream (W))) = W);

   --  Part II

   --  The inverse of the above is harder to accomplish, because there
   --  seems no easy way to write a quantifiying expression for
   --  different length arrays (at least none of the ones I could think
   --  of are less complex than the relatively simple five different
   --  expressions below).

   --  Luckily, the number of possibilities here is low, so let's simply
   --  prove all cases one by one.

   --  Proof for Stream'Length = 4

                                   General_Stream'(0 => A, 1 => B, 2 => C, 3 => D)))));
